#### Generative AI Policy

In this course, students are allowed to use any kind of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools. However, students are required to obey the following rules. Otherwise, the action will be regarded as plagiarism. 

- For tutorials, students are required to summarize all the information they gather and describe their answers based on their understanding. Directly copying the content generated by GenAI (AIGC) is not allowed. 
- For reports, students must summarize and rewrite AIGC based on their understanding. If it is necessary to include the original or most of the original AIGC in research reports related to GenAI, please declare the following items in the appendix. We will not detect the AI rate based on any tools. However, it will be very obvious if a report is almost filled with AIGC. 
  - Please declare the exact time slot when GenAI is used, including the starting and ending time slots. 
  - If online GenAI is used, please declare the version of the GenAI and provide links to the GenAI. Make sure the GenAI is accessible. 
  - If local GenAI is used, please provide configuration tutorials to the GenAI and the environment of the devices used. 
  - Please declare the original inputs and the original outputs, including the full context. 
  - Please declare the content revised if revision based on the GenAI is made.
