#### HKU Plagiarism Policy

Please note the following revised policy on "Plagiarism" from The University of Hong Kong. 

**GUIDELINES ON HANDLING CASES RELATED TO PLAGIARISM**

Plagiarism is a very serious academic offense. Students should understand what constitutes plagiarism, the consequences of committing an offense of plagiarism, and how to avoid it.

**Definition of Plagiarism**

As defined in the University's Regulations Governing Conduct at Examinations, plagiarism is "the unacknowledged use, as one's own, of work of another person, whether or not such work has been published.", or put it simply, plagiarism is copying (including paraphrasing) the work of another person (including an idea or argument) without proper acknowledgment. 

In case of queries on plagiarism, students are strongly advised to refer to "What is Plagiarism?" at [https://tl.hku.hk/plagiarism/](https://tl.hku.hk/plagiarism/). 

- Both the student who copies another's work and the student who offers his/her work for copying shall be penalized. 

- If a student commits plagiarism, with evidence after investigation, no matter whether the student concerned admits or not, a penalty will be imposed: 

  - The First Attempt: if the student commits plagiarism (in an assignment/test of a CS course) for the first time in his/her entire course of study, the student shall be warned in writing and receive a zero mark for the whole assignment or the whole test; if the student does not agree, he/she can appeal to the BEng (CompSc) Programme Director within a week. 

  - Subsequent Attempts: if the student commits plagiarism more than once in a higher course of study, the case shall be referred to the Programme Director for consideration.  The Programme Director shall investigate the case and consider referring it to the University Disciplinary Committee, which may impose any of the following penalties: a published reprimand, suspension of study for a period of time, fine, or expulsion from the University.
