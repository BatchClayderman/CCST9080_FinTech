#### FinTech (CCST 9080) Policy

For the reports of the thesis-like assignments and the final project, please do not copy any material into your reports directly. Please cite the corresponding references and describe them based on your own understanding, where you should at least rewrite the sentences by yourselves. If you indeed need some sentences directly from the references, please cite the references and quote the sentences. Do not be so worried about the repeating rate itself. Your work should be fine as long as you follow these guidelines. 

Additionally, you can insert figures, tables, equations, formulas, algorithms, and other kinds of rich text if you want your reports fruitful. Just remember not to fill all your reports with these. Following the writing style of high-quality academic papers is encouraging.
