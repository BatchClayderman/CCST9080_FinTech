#### Quiz

The quiz is expected to be held in T9 in the close-book form. All the questions are multi-choice ones, where there is only one correct choice among all the choices provided in each question. The content involved is merely related to lectures from guest speakers. Questions in each tutorial session are different. Thus, please do not try to ask the quiz questions from students from a previous tutorial session (:-P).Â
