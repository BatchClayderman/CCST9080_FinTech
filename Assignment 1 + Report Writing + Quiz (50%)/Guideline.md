#### Guideline

As we have planned so far, there is only one assignment (namely Assignment 1), one report writing task, and one quiz. They totally count as 50% of the final grade. Detailed distribution of the three will not be released. 

Assignment 1 is a group work while the report writing task is an individual one. The quiz is an individual work in the close-book form. 

There should be three students in each group to accomplish the group work. In case it is very difficult to form a group of 3, please seek approval from Prof. Yiu and forward the approval emails to TAs.
