#### Guidelines

There is an assignment (namely Assignment 1), a report writing task, and a quiz in this course. The three total 50% of the final grade. 

As we have planned so far, Assignment 1 and the report writing task contribute 20% and 30% to the final grade respectively. The quiz will take a certain percentage from these two in the future. However, the final distribution of the three will never be released. 

Assignment 1 is a group work while the report writing task is an individual one. Please refer to "Quiz" to view more details of the quiz. 

We will update you if there are any changes.Â
