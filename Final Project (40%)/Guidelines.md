#### Guidelines

Here are some details about the final project (group project). 

(1) The final project should be teamed up by 3-5 students per final project group. Any topics related to FinTech can be selected as the final project topic. You can refer but not be limited to the examples provided by Prof. Yiu. As the presentation (expected to be held in Tutorial 9) is a part of the final project finishing, all members of the group project should show up on the project presentation without excuse. 

(2) Please use the following format to prepare your final project information and send it to yueryang@connect.hku.hk for registration on or before February 26th, 2025. 

Topic: XXX (Leave it blank if you have not determined)

Final project group information: 
Student 1 (UID): email 1 (Tutorial SessionX)
Student 2 (UID): email 2 (Tutorial Session X)
Student 3 (UID): email 3 (Tutorial Session X)
...

(3) If your topic has not been decided, please leave the topic above blank when you send emails for final project group registration. You can attend more lectures first to explore the topic that really interests you. For the deadline for the topic, we will announce it at another time.  

(4) If you wish to change the final project information like topics and final project group members after the registry, please send your updated information via email again. We will send an email to inform you whether the update is approved. 

(5) You can form the final project group with members from different tutorial sessions. Nonetheless, it is highly recommended that most members come from the same tutorial session, such that we can arrange your presentation with minimal conflicts. For groups with members from different tutorial sessions, we will set the tutorial sessions in the tutorial for the final project presentation to the session where most members are from by default. Members from such groups can send requests to TAs to select a suitable tutorial session for the final project presentation.
