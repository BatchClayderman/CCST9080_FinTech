#### Guideline

The final project is a group work, where the number of the group members is to be determined. You can form groups with members from different tutorial sessions, which is not recommended. In case a group has members from different tutorial sessions, the group needs to select a suitable tutorial session to finish the final project presentation in T10, where all the group members must show up.
