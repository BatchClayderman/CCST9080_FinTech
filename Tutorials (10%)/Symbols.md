For better communication, we would like to donate the following symbols. 

- **W**: The teaching week. For example, ``W1`` stands for the first teaching week of the second semester of the 2024-2025 academic year. 
- **L**: The lecture. For example, ``L1`` stands for the first lecture of this course in the second semester of the 2024-2025 academic year. Except for holidays and the reading week, there is a lecture each Wednesday this semester. 
- **T**: The tutorial. For example, ``T1`` stands for the first tutorial of this course in the second semester of the 2024-2025 academic year. Except for holidays and the reading week, there is a tutorial each Monday or Tuesday this semester. 
- **S**: The tutorial session. For example, ``T1S1`` stands for the first session of ``T1``. There are ten tutorial sessions in each tutorial. 
- **G**: The tutorial session group. For example, ``T1S1G1`` stands for the first group of ``T1S1``. The tutorial session groups will be formed temporarily in each tutorial session of each tutorial. Please feel free to keep or change your groupmates if there are group works assigned in tutorials. Except for the last tutorial for the final project presentation, you can have different groupmates in tutorials from the final project.
