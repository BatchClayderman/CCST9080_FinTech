#### Symbols

For better communication, we would like to donate the following symbols. 

- **W**: The teaching week. For example, ``W1`` stands for the first teaching week of the second semester of the 2024-2025 academic year. 
- **L**: The lecture. For example, ``L1`` stands for the first lecture of this course in the second semester of the 2024-2025 academic year. Except for holidays and the reading week, there is a lecture each Wednesday this semester. 
- **T**: The tutorial. For example, ``T1`` stands for the first tutorial of this course in the second semester of the 2024-2025 academic year. Except for holidays and the reading week, there is a tutorial each Monday or Tuesday this semester. 
- **S**: The tutorial session. For example, ``T1S1`` stands for the first session of ``T1``. There are ten tutorial sessions in each tutorial. 
- **G**: The tutorial session group. For example, "T1S1G1" stands for the first group of "T1S1". From T1 to T8, the tutorial session groups will be formed temporarily in each tutorial session of each tutorial, that is, you can have the same or different groupmates in each tutorial from T1 to T8, Assignment 1, and the final project. For instance, T1S1G1 can be the same as or different from T2S1G1. The only limitation is that in T10, the last tutorial for the final project presentation, you must work with the same members of your final project group to complete the final report presentation. Please note that professors and TAs reverse the permissions to determine the members in each tutorial session group, Assignment 1, and the final report.Â
