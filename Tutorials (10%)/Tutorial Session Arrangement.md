Students need to attend a tutorial session **EVERY WEEK**. The overall average grade of all the tutorials (except the quiz and the final project presentation) counts as 10% of the final grade. 

There are five available tutorial sessions each Monday and five each Tuesday. Please pick a suitable time to register. Selections need to be done from 0:00 on January 23rd to 23:59 on January 26th. Every tutorial session is set with a maximum limitation of 13 students, and it works as **FIRST COME FIRST SERVE**.
